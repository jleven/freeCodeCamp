# --description--

**Objective:** Build a full stack JavaScript app that is functionally similar to this: <https://fcc-voting-arthow4n.herokuapp.com/>.

Here are the specific user stories you should implement for this project:

**User Story:** As an authenticated user, I can keep my polls and come back later to access them.

**User Story:** As an authenticated user, I can share my polls with my friends.

**User Story:** As an authenticated user, I can see the aggregate results of my polls.

**User Story:** As an authenticated user, I can delete polls that I decide I don't want anymore.

**User Story:** As an authenticated user, I can create a poll with any number of possible items.

**User Story:** As an unauthenticated or authenticated user, I can see and vote on everyone's polls.

**User Story:** As an unauthenticated or authenticated user, I can see the results of polls in chart form. (This could be implemented using Chart.js or Google Charts.)

**User Story:** As an authenticated user, if I don't like the options on a poll, I can create a new option.

Once you've finished implementing these user stories, enter the URL to your live app and, optionally, your GitHub repository. Then click the "I've completed this challenge" button.

You can get feedback on your project by sharing it on the [freeCodeCamp forum](https://forum.freecodecamp.org/c/project-feedback/409).

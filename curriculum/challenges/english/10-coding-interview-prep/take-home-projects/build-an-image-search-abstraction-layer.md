## Description

<section id='description'>

**Objective:** Build a full stack JavaScript app on [Repl.it](https://repl.it/) that allows you to search for images like this: <https://cryptic-ridge-9197.herokuapp.com/api/imagesearch/lolcats%20funny?offset=10> and browse recent search queries like this: <https://cryptic-ridge-9197.herokuapp.com/api/latest/imagesearch/>.

Here are the specific user stories you should implement for this project:

**User Story:** I can get the image URLs, alt text and page URLs for a set of images relating to a given search string.

**User Story:** I can paginate through the responses by adding a ?offset=2 parameter to the URL.

**User Story:** I can get a list of the most recently submitted search strings.

Once you've finished implementing these user stories, enter the URL to your live app and, optionally, your GitHub repository. Then click the "I've completed this challenge" button.

You can get feedback on your project by sharing it on the [freeCodeCamp forum](https://forum.freecodecamp.org/c/project-feedback/409).
